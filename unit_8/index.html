						<p>Hi! My name is Emma and I am a marketer and aspiring web designer. I currently live in Washington, D.C. after spending my university years in St. Andrews, Scotland. I have a passion for all things travel, photography, cooking and, of course, design! I am always searching for new inspirations and trends in my surroundings.</p>
						
						<p>I have recently completed a web design course thorugh General Assembly. During the 10-week intensive HTML, CSS and Web Design circut, I learned to code responsive websites and emails from scratch as well as web design and user experience theory.</p>
						
						<p>I currently work at Brand USA, the destination marketing organizaton for the United States, where I support the digital marketing team with creating and updating web content and managing the digital asset database. With my keen eye for photography, I am also responsible for preforming quality assurance to ensure all assets meet creative guidelines.</p>
						
						<p>I also have solid experience working in the communications industry. I previously worked at Edelman Public Relations on the Corporate Affairs team. Working with many Fortune 500 and national non-profit clients, I frequently drafted pitches, press releases and blog posts.</p>
						
						<p>To combine my passions for travel and cooking, I created and designed my own blog, BakedByEmma.com where I showcase my photography skills, favorite recipes and recent travel adventures.</p>
